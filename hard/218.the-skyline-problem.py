#
# A city's skyline is the outer contour of the silhouette formed by all the
# buildings in that city when viewed from a distance. Given the locations and
# heights of all the buildings, return the skyline formed by these buildings
# collectively.
# 
# The geometric information of each building is given in the array buildings
# where buildings[i] = [lefti, righti, heighti]:
# 
# 
# lefti is the x coordinate of the left edge of the i^th building.
# righti is the x coordinate of the right edge of the i^th building.
# heighti is the height of the i^th building.
# 
# 
# You may assume all buildings are perfect rectangles grounded on an absolutely
# flat surface at height 0.
# 
# The skyline should be represented as a list of "key points" sorted by their
# x-coordinate in the form [[x1,y1],[x2,y2],...]. Each key point is the left
# endpoint of some horizontal segment in the skyline except the last point in
# the list, which always has a y-coordinate 0 and is used to mark the skyline's
# termination where the rightmost building ends. Any ground between the
# leftmost and rightmost buildings should be part of the skyline's contour.
# 
# Note: There must be no consecutive horizontal lines of equal height in the
# output skyline. For instance, [...,[2 3],[4 5],[7 5],[11 5],[12 7],...] is
# not acceptable; the three lines of height 5 should be merged into one in the
# final output as such: [...,[2 3],[4 5],[12 7],...]
# 
# 
# Example 1:
# 
# 
# Input: buildings = [[2,9,10],[3,7,15],[5,12,12],[15,20,10],[19,24,8]]
# Output: [[2,10],[3,15],[7,12],[12,0],[15,10],[20,8],[24,0]]
# Explanation:
# Figure A shows the buildings of the input.
# Figure B shows the skyline formed by those buildings. The red points in
# figure B represent the key points in the output list.
# 
# 
# Example 2:
# 
# 
# Input: buildings = [[0,2,3],[2,5,3]]
# Output: [[0,3],[5,0]]
# 
# 
# 
# Constraints:
# 
# 
# 1 <= buildings.length <= 10^4
# 0 <= lefti < righti <= 2^31 - 1
# 1 <= heighti <= 2^31 - 1
# buildings is sorted by lefti inÂ non-decreasing order.

class Solution:
     #first thing first will iterate from each building if current building is left of highest building so bar we have to pop 
        #and find that x value on top then we will also pop all value whose right is small then the current max x then finally we will do current_x,
        #top of queueu height and push it in results 
        # curr_h =0 if pq other wise pq[0][0] in the current loop the loop that is checking the left of current of top from the current building 
        # if first condition is not checked then current building height has to be checked with top of queue if is bggier we have to continously push in reults 
        #and update the cuur_h
